/*
    This was my first attempt at properly learning C with a binary search algorithm, it will remain unfinished as a good
    learning experience and where I experienced my first issue with C

    When passing the array data to another function, i've experienced
    array decay = the parsed value "decayed" into a pointer referencing the arrays
    first element.
